Diary App allows users to register how they felt throughout their days.
</br>
In order to access the platform, an user must first register on the sign up page:

</p>

Once an user signs up using an unique email address, they will be automatically authenticated and taken to the home page where they can either create a new daily record or access all their daily records.

</p>

On the "Create new entry" page, users can enter how long they have exercised, how many calories they have consumed, their energy level, their sleep quality, whether they have taken vitamins and their mood.

</p>

On the "See Diary entries" page, users can see all their daily entries.
Note that, only one daily record can be created per day. However, users can edit or delete any entry they have previously posted.
Users can also use the filters in order to visualize their entries according to their needs.
